Fork the plugin repository.\n1. Hack on a separate topic branch created from the latest `master`.\n1. Commit and push the topic branch.\n1. Make a pull request.\n1. welcome to the club\n\nPlease note that modifications should follow these coding guidelines:\n\n- Indent is 2 spaces.\n- Code should pass coffeelint linter.\n- Vertical whitespace helps readability, donâ€™t be afraid to use it.\n\nThank you for helping out!\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/s-shin/linter-perl/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/s-shin/linter-perl#readme","_id":"linter-perl@0.6.2","_shasum":"2554cb2d3396396e3209cc59f06eb5b83aea1290","_resolved":"file:../d-115912-5279-jm8xcz/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115912-5279-jm8xcz/package.tgz"}
