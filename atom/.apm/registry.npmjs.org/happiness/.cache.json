JavaScript Happiness Style\n[![travis][travis-image]][travis-url]\n[![npm][npm-image]][npm-url]\n[![downloads][downloads-image]][downloads-url]\n\n[Standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) customised to make [me](http://github.com/JedWatson/) happy.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install happiness\n```\n\n## Rules\n\nImportantly:\n\n- **semicolons**\n- **tabs**\n- Check [feross/standard] for the rest of the rules.\n\n## Badge\n\nUse this in one of your projects? Include one of these badges in your readme to\nlet people know that your code is using the standard style.\n\n[![js-happiness-style](https://cdn.rawgit.com/JedWatson/happiness/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JedWatson/happiness)\n\n```markdown\n[![js-happiness-style](https://cdn.rawgit.com/JedWatson/happiness/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JedWatson/happiness)\n```\n\n[![js-happiness-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-happiness-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/feross/standard)\n\n```markdown\n[![js-happiness-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-happiness-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/feross/standard)\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe easiest way to use JavaScript happiness Style to check your code is to install it\nglobally as a Node command line program. To do so, simply run the following command in\nyour terminal (flag `-g` installs `happiness` globally on your system, omit it if you want\nto install in the current working directory):\n\n```bash\nnpm install happiness -g\n```\n\nAfter you've done that you should be able to use the `happiness` program. The simplest use\ncase would be checking the style of all JavaScript files in the current working directory:\n\n```\n$ happiness\nError: Use JavaScript happiness Style\n  lib/torrent.js:950:11: Expected '===' and instead saw '=='.\n```\n\n### Editor plugins\n\n- **Sublime users**: Try [SublimeLinter-contrib-happiness](https://github.com/JedWatson/SublimeLinter-contrib-happiness) for linting in your editor!\n- **Atom users** - Install [Linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter) and [linter-js-standard](https://atom.io/packages/linter-js-standard) (don't you mind with the misleading name it supports both styles).\n\n\n### What you might do if you're clever\n\n1. Add it to `package.json`\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"name\": \"my-cool-package\",\n    \"devDependencies\": {\n      \"happiness\": \"*\"\n    },\n    \"scripts\": {\n      \"test\": \"happiness && node my-normal-tests-littered-with-semicolons.js\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n2. Check style automatically when you run `npm test`\n\n  ```\n  $ npm test\n  Error: Code style check failed:\n    lib/torrent.js:950:11: Expected '===' and instead saw '=='.\n  ```\n\n3. Never give style feedback on a pull request again! (unless it's about semicolons)\n\n\nSee [feross/standard] for more information.\n\n[travis-image]: https://img.shields.io/travis/JedWatson/happiness.svg?style=flat-square\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/JedWatson/happiness\n[npm-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/happiness.svg?style=flat-square\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/happiness\n[downloads-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/happiness.svg?style=flat-square\n[downloads-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/happiness\n[feross/standard]: https://github.com/feross/standard\n\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to [Flet](https://github.com/Flet/) and his work on [semistandard](https://github.com/Flet/semistandard) for making this super easy to build on [standard](https://github.com/feross/standard).\n","maintainers":[{"name":"jedwatson","email":"jed.watson@me.com"},{"name":"dcousens","email":"email@dcousens.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-07-03T10:57:23.628Z","created":"2015-05-27T04:05:57.272Z","1.0.0":"2015-05-27T04:05:57.272Z","1.0.1":"2015-05-27T04:37:53.814Z","1.0.2":"2015-05-28T03:05:20.783Z","1.0.3":"2015-05-29T06:17:13.697Z","1.0.4":"2015-05-29T07:43:20.693Z","1.0.5":"2015-05-30T06:07:10.772Z","1.0.6":"2015-06-03T13:51:41.804Z","1.0.7":"2015-07-03T10:57:23.628Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/JedWatson/happiness","keywords":["JavaScript Standard Style","bikeshed","check","checker","code","code checker","code linter","code standards","code style","enforce","eslint","happiness","hint","jscs","jshint","lint","policy","quality","semicolon","simple","standard","standard style","style","style checker","style linter","verify"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/JedWatson/happiness.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/JedWatson/happiness/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"nehakadam":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"4X4PJWH1C5MKFU9U8UQEUFT7Y\""}
